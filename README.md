# Project Name: casino⚫🔴🃏🎰💲💳💰🕒🎲


Welcome to the Casino repository! This project consists of three main components: `main.py`, `gamemodes.py`, and a CSV file for data storage.

## Description

This project aims to create a game with different game modes, utilizing a modular structure with separate files for lobby functions (`main.py`), game functions (`gamemodes.py`), and a CSV file to store data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
  
   git clone https://github.com/jigata120/casino.git
  
# Usage
To run the game and interact with the different components, follow these steps:

Run the main.py file to access the lobby functions.

This file handles the lobby functionality, including user authentication and account functions.

The gamemode.py file contains the game functions for different game modes. Import the necessary functions from this file in main.py to incorporate the game features.

The CSV file (data.csv) serves as the data storage medium for the project. Ensure that the necessary permissions are set for read and write operations.
